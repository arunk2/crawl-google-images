Crawl Google Images
===================

### Google Image Search API
allows us to programatically do image search and crawl image data. But it is limited maximum of 8 result pages => 64 results. Also, it must be used for user-generated searches. **Automated** or batched queries of any kind are strictly **prohibited**.

## How this system crawls?
We built a selenium based system - simulating user searching for images and saving the results to local machine.
